# Introduction

![TuffySearch](/tuffysearch.png)

Welcome to the TuffySearch API docs! This comprehensive guide is designed to assist student developers in harnessing the power
of our API to access detailed course information _effortlessly_. Dive into our documentation to explore the capabilities
and endpoints of our API.

## Motivation

The TuffySearch API was created to provide a simple and easy way for students to access CSUF course information. As a developer,
the driving force behind this API was the headache of having to scrape and process the HTML of the course catalog to get
the information I needed. By streamlining the process of accessing course information, we hope to encourage students to
create more innovative and useful applications for all CSUF students.

## Where does the data come from?

The data for the TuffySearch API is sourced from the [CSUF Course Catalog](https://catalog.fullerton.edu/). The data is
scraped and processed using a custom-built web scraper. The scraper is written in Python and uses the [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
library to parse the HTML of the course catalog. The data is then stored in a MySQL database and served to you through
our API.

## Join other CSUF developers

If you have questions about anything related to the TuffySearch API, computer science, or just want to hang out with other
CSUF developers, join the [ACM Discord](https://acmcsuf.com/discord). ACM at CSUF is the largest computer science community on campus.
