# Introduction

Welcome to the TuffySearch API docs! This comprehensive guide is designed to assist student developers in harnessing the power
of our API to access detailed course information _effortlessly_. Dive into our documentation to explore the capabilities
and endpoints of our API.

## Motivation

The TuffySearch API was created to provide a simple and easy way for students to access course information. As a developer,
the driving force behind this API was the headache of having to scrape and process the HTML of the course catalog to get
the information I needed. By streamlining the process of accessing course information, we hope to encourage students to
create more innovative and useful applications for all CSUF students.
