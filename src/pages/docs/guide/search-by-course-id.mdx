# Search by Course ID

<small>Returns a `CourseObject` for the given course ID.</small>

Searches the CSUF course catalog for a course with the given ID.

This endpoint will likely not get used much, but it's here for completeness.
The only place I found with course IDs was in the `<a>{:html}` tags of the
course catalog search results page.

### Endpoint

```bash
GET /courses/course_id/{course_id}
```

### Parameters

`course_id` - The course id to search for. This is typically a 6-digit number.

### Response Example

```json filename="GET /courses/course_id/538057"
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "title": "Object-Oriented Programming",
    "description": "The object-oriented programming paradigm: ...",
    "department": "Computer Science",
    "course_code": "CPSC 121",
    "course_id": 538057
  }
}
```
