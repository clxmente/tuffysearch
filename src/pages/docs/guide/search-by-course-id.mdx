# Search by Course ID

<small>Returns a `CourseObject` for the given course ID.</small>

Searches the CSUF course catalog for a course with the given ID.

This endpoint will likely not get used much, but it's here for completeness.
The only place I found with course IDs was in the `<a>{:html}` tags of the
course catalog search results page.

### Endpoint

```bash
GET /courses/course_id/{course_id}
```

### Parameters

| Name        | Description                         | Example  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | -------- |
| `course_id` | The ID of the course to search for. | `538057` |

### Responses
